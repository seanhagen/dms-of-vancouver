Hey! Welcome to our very first episode. 

Today we sit down to talk with our buddy Ray, who has nearly two decades of
DM-ing experience. The topic is Session Zero. If you've never heard of Session
Zero, you're in luck! In this episode we go over some of the basics of what a DM
should and shouldn't cover in their own Session Zero.
