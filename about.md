title: About Us
---

We're two guys -- [Jessy Boros](http://twitter.com/JessyTheRed)
and [Sean Hagen](http://seanhagen.ca) -- who want to become better DMs. We
figure the best way to do that is to sit down and talk to other DMs and pick
their brain on a variety of topics. 

We cover all kinds of topcs, from the basics like building encounters & running
a session zero -- all the way up to more advanced stuff like diving into
worldbuilding & improv DM-ing.

## Questions?

If you've got a question you'd like to ask, you can get in touch in multiple
ways. [Reach out to us on Twitter at @dmsofvancouver](https://twitter.com/{{site.social.twitter}}),
or
[hit us up on our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/{{site.social.facebook}}). You
can even email us at [dmsofvancouver AT gmail DOT com](mailto:{{site.social.email}}).

## More On The Hosts

### Jessy

Jessy has been playing D&D and other tabletop games for just over a
decade. He ran an partially successful campaign for about eight
months before falling victim to DM fatigue. Now he hopes running this
podcast will help him to a better job next time he gets behind the
screen.

### Sean

Sean has been a DM for little more than a year now. He's run games in D&D,
Paranoia, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, and a few other systems. A big believer
that the entire job of the DM is to enhance player fun and empower awesome stories.
