In this episode we talk to Sean Hobbis about managing campaign scope and length. As a newer DM, it can be useful to reign in your scope and focus on a single city or region, instead of trying to create a whole world from scratch. We go over a few ways that you can do this, but still have your campaign be just as memorable as if it was a globe-trotting romp.
