Welcome to our humble site!

If you want to know more about what's going on here, check out
our [about page](/about/).

We hope to be posting one episode a month at first. Once we get the hang of this
whole podcasting thing ( scheduling, editing, etc ), we're going to try and do
two a month. 

Although we've already got a lot to cover, we'd love to hear what kinds of
issues or concerns new DMs are running into as they first start out. Reach out
to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmsofvancouver)
or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dmsofvancouver) to send us your
questions, and we'll do our best to cover them.

Looking forward to helping everybody out there get a little bit better at DM-ing
-- including ourselves!

Happy gaming, folks.
